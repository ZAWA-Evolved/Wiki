# Welcome!

This is the **official ZAWA: Evolved wiki**! It is maintained by ZAWA staff, and should contain accurate information on the mod.

Looking around the wiki, you may find empty or missing pages. This is intended! Information will not be updated until it has made a public release or reveal. :) Enjoy speculating on anything that may be `REDACTED`!

## How to download
Versions needed:
* Minecraft: 1.16.5
* Forge: [36.2.20 (or newer)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html)

ZAWA: Evolved's Curseforge page: <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/zawa-evolved>

Download the latest file and put it in your mods folder! Or, you can also import ZAWA through various mod launchers (CurseForge, MultiMC, GDLauncher are all good options).

NEVER download ZAWA from any website that isn't curseforge.com!! Other websites steal mod files and upload them without the author's permission; these files can be corrupted and possibly even give your computer a virus. [Stop mod reposts!](https://stopmodreposts.org/)

## Modpacks
You are permitted to add ZAWA: Evolved to your modpack; however, all public modpacks must be through Curseforge. Public redistribution of ZAWA: Evolved is **not** permitted. Support our team by downloading our mod from Curseforge!

Does your modpack have modded items that you think should be included in ZAWA's animal's diet? Check out our guide on [[customizing ZAWA: Evolved|data-packs]]!
